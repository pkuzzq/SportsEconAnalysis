### Import Data

We check the relationship of having 
health insurance and a person's education. 
We use `age` and `family` as control variables


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(AER)
data(HealthInsurance)
head(HealthInsurance) # display the data structure
```

### Prepare Data

Convert the factor variable `insurance` to numeric, 
otherwise `lm()` will not accept it as a dependent variable

```{r}
HealthInsurance$ins = (HealthInsurance$insurance == "yes")
```

### Regression 

Run the OLS regression and print the output.
```{r}
reg = lm( ins ~  education + age + family, data = HealthInsurance)
summary(reg)
```


### Inference 
Use the robust standard error.
```{r}
coeftest(reg, vcov = sandwich)
```
