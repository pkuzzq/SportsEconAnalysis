This script computes the up-to-date degree of excess from the return time series of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index.
  
We download data from Yahoo Finance, and check the head and tail of the dataset.

```{r}  
# install.packages("timeDate") # if use the packages for the first time, must install it.
library(timeDate) # load a package

SS = read.csv("http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=000001.SS") 
# download data of SSE composite index

head(SS)
tail(SS)
# display the dataset
```

Then we generate the time series of log return $R_{t} = \log p_{t} - \log p_{t-1}$.

```{r}
sc = rev(SS$Close) # revert the time series
T = dim(SS)[1] # compute the length of the time series
return = log( sc[2:T] ) - log( sc[1:(T-1)] ) # compute the log return
plot(return, type="l")
```

Finally, we compute the degree of excess, which is $E[ (X - \mu)^4 / \sigma^4 ] - 3$.
```{r}
k = kurtosis(return)
print(k)
```
