# What is economics?

---
# What is economics?

According to [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes),

&gt; The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.

---
# Why study economics?

--

Develop critical thinking **skills that employers value**.

--

Cultivate **healthy skepticism**.

--

Learn to navigate a diverse set of **policy-relevant** questions.

---
# Why study economics?

## Navigate important questions

--

- Should college be free?

--

- Would universal healthcare make us healthier?

--

- Who benefits from a $15 minimum wage? Who suffers?

--

- Why is the rent so damn high?

--

- What can governments do to address climate change?

--

- Why are governments taking so long to address climate change?

---
# Why study economics?

## Navigate important questions

- Does immigration reduce wages for native workers?

--

- Do cigarette taxes make smokers happier?

--

- How much should the university charge out-of-state students?

--

- Should cities pay for professional sports stadiums?

--

- How does grade inflation affect labor market outcomes? 

--

- Why is there grade inflation?

class: clear-slide

**Q:** Do additional freeway lanes .hi-green[reduce congestion?]

&lt;img src="portland_traffic.png" width="294" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

How do additional lanes .green[change the **price**] of driving .green[**relative** to alternative modes] of transportation?

&lt;img src="transport_alternatives.jpg" width="303" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Q:** Should the federal government .green[legalize cannabis?]

&lt;img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

What about .green[meth?]

--

**The bigger question:** What are the relevant trade-offs of legalization?

---
class: clear-slide

**Q:** Does a "kingpin" strategy weaken drug cartels?

- Principal strategy in Mexico's War on Drugs

--

- New cartels .mono[=&gt;] more competition .mono[=&gt;] more violence

&lt;img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
class: clear-slide

**Q:** Should the government require insurance companies to pay for a second night in the hospital following childbirth?

- Overnight hospital stays are expensive.

    - How expensive? Expensive enough that parents rarely opt to pay for a second night.
    
--

- If insurance companies are required to cover two nights, then .green[premiums will increase].

--

**The real question:** Are you willing to make some parents more comfortable if it means that .green[others will lose coverage] for basic care?

---
class: clear-slide

**Q:** Suppose you learn that orchestras employ many more male musicians than female musicians? **How would you explain this?**

&lt;img src="symphony.png" width="384" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Do orchestras .hi[discriminate] against women?

--

**Natural experiment:** In the 1950s, American orchestras introduced "blind" auditions.

- **Result:** Women 50% more likely to make past the first round and several times more likely to make the final cut.

--

- **Takeaway:** The evidence is *consistent* with discrimination.

---
class: clear-slide

**Q:** The university has a fixed number of student tickets for each home football game. Which of the following ways of dispensing tickets is discriminatory?

&gt; **A.** First come, first served.

&gt; **B.** Distribute them using a random drawing.

&gt; **C.** Raise the price until that number of students want tickets.

&gt; **D.** Distribute them according to GPA.

&gt; **E.** All of the above.

# What is economics?

## Textbook definitions

&gt; The study of how humans coordinate their wants.

--

&gt; The study of how scarce resources, each having alternative uses, are allocated amongst competing ends.

--

&gt; The study of how individuals and societies allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wants.

--

**Common thread:** .hi[scarcity]

- A not-so-dismal .green[objective:] learn how we can better .green[mitigate the costs of scarcity.]

---
# What is economics?

## Micro *vs.* Macro

**Microeconomics** focuses on the causes and consequences of the choices people make in a market economy.

- What factors constrain the choices of individuals? How do people respond when we relax those constraints or impose new ones? Do we like the consequences?

**Macroeconomics** focuses on the performance of entire economies.

- How do we grow the economy and avoid recessions?

---
# Is economics a science?

Economics seeks to explain real-world events by way of .green[observation] .mono[-&gt;] .green[hypothesis] .mono[-&gt;] .green[prediction] .mono[-&gt;] .green[experimentation] .mono[-&gt;] .green[conclusion].

--

Economists employ the .green[scientific method] to learn about human behavior.

- Difficult to conduct controlled experiments like those in chemistry or physics.

- **Alternative:** approximate controlled experiments with [randomized control trials](https://www.ted.com/talks/esther_duflo_social_experiments_to_fight_poverty?language=en), psychology-style lab experiments, and natural experiments.

---
# Is economics a science?

Focus on *human* behavior .mono[=&gt;] social science.

The core fields of social science are anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology.

- Common objective: explain some aspect of human behavior.

- They differ in the questions they pose and their frameworks for analysis.

---
# Example: *Blue Paradox*

[Recent study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/12/5319) by UO economist [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com) and coauthors.

**Question:** Do commercial fishers preempt fishing bans by increasing their fishing effort before the bans go into effect?

**Motivation**

- Recent conservation efforts seek to preserve aquatic habitat and increase fish stocks.
- Policy lever: Restrict fishing activity in marine protected areas.
- Concern: Preemptive behavior could *decrease* fish stocks.

--

**Approach**

- Use vessel-level data on fishing effort/intensity to measure the behavioral response to impending fishing restrictions.

---
# Example: *Blue Paradox*

**Natural Experiment**

Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) 

- First mentioned on 1 September 2014; implemented 1 January 2015.
- *Treatment group:* PIPA.
- *Control group:* Outlying Kiribati islands. 

&lt;img src="figure2.jpg" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Example: *Blue Paradox*

**Natural Experiment**

Measure the causal effect of the fishing ban by comparing fishing effort in treatment and control regions, before-and-after PIPA.

- A *difference-in-differences* comparison.

- .hi-red[Assumption:] .red[If Kiribati hadn't adopted the policy, then treatment region would have experienced the same trend in fishing activity as the control region.] 

- If we believe this assumption, then the observed difference-in-differences supports a causal interpretation. If not, then the change could reflect other factors and thus fail to isolate the causal effect of the ban.

---
# Example: *Blue Paradox*

**Results**

&lt;img src="figure3.jpg" width="629" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Example: *Blue Paradox*

**Discussion**

Results provide causal evidence that commercial fishers engage in preemptive behavior in response to conservation policy changes.

Results are *consistent* with economic theory, but *cannot prove* that the theory is correct.

- **Science cannot prove anything.**
- Science can .hi[falsify or reject] existing hypotheses or .hi[corroborate] existing evidence.

--

Also...the causal statement rests on a critical assumption.

- Cannot prove that the assumption is true, but can falsify it.
- Failure to falsify .mono[!=] assumption is true.

---
# What role should economists play?

It will be important for us to separate our beliefs about *what is desirable* from what we believe to be *true or false.*

--

Robust economic analysis consists of .hi[positive] statements.

- *Positive statement* .mono[=] statement that can be classified as either true or false.

--

Economists try to avoid .hi[normative] statements in their analyses.

- *Normative statement* .mono[=] statement expressing a value judgement or *what ought to be.* 

- No matter how widely shared, value judgements are not scientifically justifiable (*i.e.,* they are untestable).

---
# What role should economists play?

**Q:** Is there a role for the normative?

- **A:** To the extent that it is supported by well-defined positive statements, yes.

- *e.g.,* evidence-based policy recommendations.

---
# Positive or normative?

*"The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent."*

--

- **A:** Positive statement.

--

*"Congress should abolish ICE."*

--

- **A:** Normative statement.

--

*"The expiration of the US Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 2004 increased gun violence in neighboring Mexican states."*

--

- **A:** Positive statement.

---
# Positive or normative?

*"Vaccines cause autism."*

--

- **A:** Positive statement...that happens to be false.

--

*"When coupled with counseling, housing vouchers provide a cost-effective means to move low-income families to high-opportunity neighborhoods. Policymakers should consider incorporating additional counseling services into federal housing assistance programs."*

--

- **A:** Normative statement supported by a positive statement.

---

---
# Prices

**Q:** Who coordinates the needs and wants of the 325 million people in the US economy?

- No individual commands more than a tiny part of the production of any good.

- Each individual, acting in self-interest on narrowly-defined projects, creates useful goods for consumers in exchange for wages or other remuneration.

- These activities are based on mutual benefits, coordinated by market-determined .hi-green[prices].

# Economic Learning

## Five important dimensions

1. Economic reasoning

2. Economic terminology

3. Economic insights

4. Economic institutions

5. Economic policy

---
# Economic Learning

## 1. Economic reasoning

Framework for formulating and answering questions

How does one think as an economist?

- Define the relevant benefits and costs.

- Define the margins of importance.

- Construct a predictive model that explains past behavior and predicts future behavior.

---
# Economic Learning

## 2. Economic terminology

Terminology abounds

- *e.g.,* marginal benefit, marginal cost, market power, externalities, adverse selection, price controls, utility, profit, *etc.*

**Q:** Why bother? 

**A:** Discipline-specific terminology facilitates quick and precise communication of complex ideas.

---
# Economic Learning

## 3. Economic insights

We base insights on economic theory.

- Theory provides generalizations about the inner workings of an abstract economy.

- *e.g.,* who coordinates the needs and wants of the millions of people in the US economy? 

---
# Economic Learning

## 4. Economic institutions

An institution is a physical or mental structure that influences economic decisions.

- *e.g.,* markets, private property, slavery, religion, *etc.*

-  Differences in institutions can explain differences in living standards, inequality, and the way people coordinate their wants.

---
# Economic Learning

## 5. Economic policy

An intervention by a government, manager, or professor that seeks to manipulate incentives associated with a particular behavior.

- To increase educational attainment among poor children, Mexico pays low-income mothers based on their children’s school attendance.

- To deter shirking, Amazon ranks its employees and fires those toward the bottom of the rankings.

- To reduce the expected benefits of cheating, I generate a randomized seating chart for exams.

---
# Incentives

.hi[People respond to incentives], but not always in the way policymakers want.

**Example:** License plate rationing in Mexico City

&lt;img src="mexico_city_smog.png" width="533" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Incentives

**The big question:** Given that humans are self-interested, how does one conduct policy to promote social welfare?

- When are incentives aligned with what is socially desirable?

- When are they misaligned?

---
# Our Priorities

Develop a base of knowledge from which you can build sound arguments for or against economic policies and observations.

- Build a foundation for further study in economics.

- Furnish new critical thinking skills.

- Calibrate your skepticism.
