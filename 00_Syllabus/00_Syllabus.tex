\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course will help you identify key economic concepts and construct
logical sports analyses.We will discuss various applications of economic
theory to the topic of sports in this class.This class is being offered
because the world of sports provides so many clear opportunities to
apply and test economic ideas - not so that sports fans can take a class
where they have advantages over others who are less interested in
sports.We are focusing on economics rather than sports.Furthermore, we
take into account key research skills and abilities such as writing an
acdamic article, leading a paper discussion section, and creating a
simple workable project proposal.

Students should be familiar with intermediate microeconomics and, at the
very least, the analytical tools of econometrics.Class participation is
essential for doing well and scoring well in this course.If you do not
intend to attend on a regular basis, I would recommend finding another
class.

The assessment of academic performance will be based on the collective
outcome of the group work, involvement in class, completion of
assignments and presence in lectures. The group project will be due
before the start of class session \#5 and two of the groups will be
asked to make short presentations of their work during the final session
(\#6).

\hypertarget{course-objectives-student-learning-outcomes}{%
\section{Course Objectives \& Student Learning
Outcomes:}\label{course-objectives-student-learning-outcomes}}

Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Interpret, construct and analyze economic models that apply to various
  settings in sports.
\item
  Understand the incentives that influence and motivate the various
  participants involved in sports (e.g., players, fans, owners, city
  officials, and so on).
\item
  Think critically about how economic issues related to both efficiency
  and equity apply to the field of sports.
\item
  Understand how classic demographic factors including race, gender,
  geography (i.e.~urban/rural), nationality, age, and even political
  affiliation relate to the field of sports.
\item
  Identify the relationships between various national/state/local
  governments and sports leagues, and understand why they are important.
\item
  Apply the economic concepts we cover to current issues in sports.
  Unfortunately, this course has a distinct bias towards American Sports
  activities, mostly because of the distribution of OU's student body as
  well as mine own areas of expertise -- but hopefully connections to
  broader global sports (i.e., Olympics, sports in developing countries,
  etc) will be given some attention.
\item
  All of these objectives will be tested through a combination of
  engaged class discussions, graded quizzes/exams, and a semester-long
  data driven research paper/project.

\section{Course Components}\label{course-components}}

\textbf{Teaching Moments}

In this course, we will take the opportunity to learn about teaching by
\emph{doing} some teaching in-class or planning for a lesson that we
might teach. There will be 5 points in the quarter where you will engage
in a teaching moment. A teaching moment is a moment in which you are
actively teaching others or discussing how you would hypothetically
teach others.

\emph{Teaching Moment \#1}: This will be a \emph{Microteaching session}
for which you will prepare 5 minutes of teaching on a topic of your
choice. During class-time, you will teach the class and then afterward
the group will give feedback to identify strengths and weaknesses. After
debriefing with the class, you will write a 1-paragraph reflection about
the experience and your key takeaways.

\emph{Teaching Moment \#2}: You will prepare a 1-page lesson plan for a
\emph{discussion} that you could potentially use for a 50-minute
section. Select a topic from the topic-bank on Canvas and then decide
the content that you would use. Submit your plans to Canvas, and be
prepared to discuss them in class.

\emph{Teaching Moment \#3}: You will prepare a 1-page lesson plan for a
\emph{lecture} that you could potentially use for a 50-minute section.
Select a topic from the topic-bank and then decide the content that you
would use. Submit your plans to Canvas, and be prepared to discuss them
in class.

\emph{Teaching Moment \#4}: You will prepare a 1-page lesson plan for an
\emph{activity} that you could potentially use for a 50-minute section.
Select a topic from the topic-bank and then decide the content that you
would use. Submit your plans to Canvas, and be prepared to discuss them
in class.

\emph{Teaching Moment \#5}: For the final teaching moment, you will
\emph{teach a 10-minute version of one of the lessons that you submitted
for teaching moments \#2 - \#4}. During our final class meeting you will
teach for 10 minutes. Students in the course will play the role of
students in your section. Afterward, you will evaluate yourself and
submit a brief reflection with key takeaways from your experience.

\textbf{Grading Assignment}

To help prepare you for grading, you will be given some exams from an
undergraduate sociology course to grade. You will design a grading
rubric and grade three student exams. You will be assessed on the
thoroughness of your rubric and whether you apply it in the comments and
grades that you give.

\hypertarget{course-policy}{%
\section{Course Policy}\label{course-policy}}

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%
\subsection{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will be determined by participation in
  class meetings.
\item
  \textbf{60\%} of your grade will be determined by completing 5
  teaching moments. Teaching Moment \#1 is worth \textbf{10\%}. Teaching
  Moments \#2-\#4 are worth \textbf{10\%} each. The final Teaching
  Moment (\#5) is worth \textbf{20\%}.
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will be determined by completing the
  grading assignment.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsection{Late Work}\label{late-work}}

All assignments and due dates have been posted on Canvas to help you
plan. Please double check due dates and times. I understand that other
priorities arise and can result in a late assignment submission. For
this class, you are allowed 3 ``late days'' for your assignments. The
``3 late days'' policy means that there would be no penalty if you
submitted one of the assignments three days late, or three of the
assignments one day late. After those 3 ``late days'' are used up, you
will be docked on the following system:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 day late: 25\% of the maximum allowable marks
\item
  2 days late: 50\% of the maximum allowable marks
\item
  3+ days late: 75\% of the maximum allowable marks
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{attendance-policy}{%
\subsection{Attendance Policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

Each of you are important to the in-class discussion and student
learning, so missed classes will be reflected in your participation
grade. I understand that unexpected circumstances occur and attendance
in-person or on Zoom may not always be possible. \textbf{If you are
unable to make one of our class meetings, please contact me in advance
and we will work out alternative arrangements.} Only missed classes that
are not made up will impact your participation grade.

\hypertarget{course-privacy}{%
\subsection{Course Privacy}\label{course-privacy}}

Two of our class meetings are scheduled to take place on Zoom. These are
marked in the class schedule, so that you can plan accordingly. For
these classes we will adhere to the university's course privacy policy.
The
\href{https://library.stanford.edu/using/copyright-reminder/common-situations/recording-broadcasting-courses}{university's
policy around recording and broadcasting courses} states that students
may not audio or video record class meetings without permission from the
instructor (and guest speakers, when applicable). If the instructor
grants permission or if the teaching team posts videos themselves,
students may keep recordings only for personal use and may not post
recordings on the Internet, or otherwise distribute them. These policies
protect the privacy rights of instructors and students, and the
intellectual property and other rights of the university. Students who
need lectures recorded for the purposes of an academic accommodation
should contact the \href{https://oae.stanford.edu/}{Office of Accessible
Education}.

\hypertarget{the-honor-code}{%
\subsection{The Honor Code}\label{the-honor-code}}

It is expected that you and I will follow Stanford's Honor Code in all
matters relating to this online course. You are encouraged to meet and
exchange ideas with your classmates while studying and working on
assignments, but you are individually responsible for your own work. You
are not permitted to copy or otherwise reference another student's work.
Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences,
including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of
the assignment, failure of the course, disciplinary probation,
suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

You, as students, are responsible for understanding the University's
Honor Code policy and must make proper use of citations of sources for
writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking
examinations, and doing research. For tips on how to uphold the honor
code in an online learning environment, read these recommendations. If
you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact me.

\hypertarget{academic-accomodations}{%
\subsection{Academic Accomodations}\label{academic-accomodations}}

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible
Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with
required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare
an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in
which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon
as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.
Contact the \href{http://oae.stanford.edu}{OAE} at 650-723-1066.

\hypertarget{mental-well-being}{%
\subsection{Mental Well-Being}\label{mental-well-being}}

As a student, you may experience a range of other challenges that can
cause barriers to learning. These mental health concerns or stressful
events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your
ability to participate in daily life. If you or someone you know is
feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are
available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential
mental health services available on campus here:
\href{https://caps.stanford.edu/}{Counseling \& Psychological Services
(CAPS)}. Within the department, you can also contact your Wellness
Information Network for Graduate Students (WINGS) representatives: Amy
Johnson
(\href{mailto:aljohnson@stanford.edu}{\nolinkurl{aljohnson@stanford.edu}})
and Cat Sanchez
