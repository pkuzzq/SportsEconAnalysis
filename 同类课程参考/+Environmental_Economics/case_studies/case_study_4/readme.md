# Case Study #4 - Bivariate Mapping
This repository sub-folder provides instructions and code to create a simple bivariate map of drinking water quality and demographic characteristics for the state of Texas. 

# Install R and RStudio
This case study requires the use of the *R* programming language. *R* is free and available for download [here](https://www.r-project.org/). While you can use *R* on it's own, downloading *RStudio* provides a welcoming environment (an integrated development environment, or IDE) that is useful for replication and allows use of the *Rmarkdown* functionality. It is free and available for download [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

# Optional: Install GitHub
*Github* is free and available for download [here](https://desktop.github.com/). *Github* is used to house this repository and by installing and using it to clone the repository one will simplify the replication procedure. However, you could also simply download a zipped file version of this repository, unzip in the desired location on your machine, and follow the replication procedures outlined below.

# Cloning the Repository
To clone or download this repository, navigate to the [main page of this repo](https://github.com/bryanparthum/environmental_economics) and click on the green "code" button in the top right corner of the page and follow the instructions (this will also provide you with an option to download a .zip file of the repository). Alternatively, navigate in the command line terminal to where you would like to clone the repository and then type: 

```
git clone https://github.com/bryanparthum/environmental_economics
```

If you chose to download a .zip file of the repository, simply unzip it to wherever you would like to have it and proceed with the following steps in that directory.

# The Bivariate Map
To get started with the replication (after installing *R*, *RStudio*, and cloning/downloading the repository), navigate in your file explorer (or equivalent) to `case_studies\case_study_4` and double click on (open) the markdown file `bivariate_mapping.Rmd`. This will prompt your machine to open the file in *RStudio*. This markdown document includes all the instructions and code to create a bivariate map.
