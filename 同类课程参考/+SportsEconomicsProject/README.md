# Is Covid-19 to Blame?
This repository contains the code dedicated to the sports economics project "Is Covid-19 to Blame? Explaining Decreased Attendance in the 2021-22 NBA and NHL Seasons" by Giancarlo Arcese (me) and advised by professor Benjamin Anderson of Colgate University. Scripts for collecting raw data, cleaning the raw data, and a shiny app are all included. For a visualzation of the data, see the shiny app [here](https://gtarcese.shinyapps.io/sports_econ_project/).

This project seeks to determine whether local Covid-19 activity, measured by the weekly total of new cases or deaths at a city, impacted attendance to professional sports matches (NBA & NHL). We specifically study the NBA and NHL since both sports are played in a closed stadium where risk of contracting Covid-19 is greatest. A linear regression model will be the paper's primary econometric technique.

I completed a thesis on this topic already during my Senior year at Colgate University. A (slightly updated) copy of the thesis can be found in the repository [here](https://github.com/Garcese/sports_econ_project/blob/main/thesis.pdf). This project was also presnented at the New York State Economics Association 2022 conference in the undergraduate research section, winning first prize. A copy of the presentation slides can be found [here](https://github.com/Garcese/sports_econ_project/blob/main/arcese_NYSEA22_presentation.pdf).
