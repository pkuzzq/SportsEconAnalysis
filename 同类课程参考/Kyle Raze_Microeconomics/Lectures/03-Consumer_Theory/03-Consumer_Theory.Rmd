# Prologue

---
# Demand and Supply

## Foundations

If goods and time were not scarce, then we would never have to choose among competing alternatives.

- .hi-pink[Consumer theory] characterizes .pink[consumers' choices] in a systematic way.

- .hi-purple[Producer theory] characterizes .purple[producers' and sellers' choices] in a systematic way.

---
# Demand

**Q:** What constrains our consumption of goods?

--

**A:** Lots of things!

- Our income or wealth.
- Price of the good.
- Legality of consuming the good.
- Cost of maintaining the good.
- Our health.
- Our finite existence.
- *etc.*

---
# Demand

**Q:** If we could measure those constraints for a group of individuals, could we predict the choices of those individuals?

--

- **A:** No. To predict behavior, we also need to consider individual tastes or preferences.

--

**Q:** Can we measure tastes or preferences?

--

- **A:** Not typically.

---
# Demand

Our inability to measure preferences requires us to make assumptions.

- However preferences are defined, they do not change during the course of the investigation.

- Preferences are such that individuals strive to reduce the adverse consequences of the constraints they face.

Given those assumptions, we can make refutable hypotheses about how individuals respond to *changes* in the constraints they face.

# Consumer Choice

---
# Individual Preferences

Economists seek to understand the combined actions of individuals.

However, the forthcoming behavioral assumptions concern individual preferences.

- Why? Because describing the preferences of a group is extraordinarily difficult. 

---
# Group Preferences

**Scenario:** Three officials in the current administration have preferences over three ways to respond to recent US-Iran tensions.

- **Official 1:** *bomb them* .mono[>] *impose sanctions* .mono[>] *do nothing*
- **Official 2:** *impose sanctions* .mono[>] *do nothing* .mono[>] *bomb them*
- **Official 3:** *do nothing* .mono[>] *bomb them* .mono[>] *impose sanctions*

--

**Q:** How do we define preferences for this group? 

- What does "the group" prefer?

--

**A:** `r emo::ji("shrug")`

--

- For any course of action, a majority would rather do something else!

---
# Behavioral Assumptions

Four assumptions buy us the ability to model consumer behavior:

1. People have preferences.

2. People prefer more over less.

3. People are willing to substitute.

4. The marginal value of a good decreases as one consumes more of it.

--

**Note:** These assumptions may rule out some realistic behaviors.

---
# Valuation

The value of a good .mono[=] what you are willing to give up to obtain it.

- If you give up .mono[$]30,000-worth of other goods to buy a car, then you value the car at a minimum of .mono[$]30,000.

--

We will maintain that an object's value is limited to what people are willing to pay for the right to control the object.

---
# Total Value

## Definition 1

> The .pink[maximum] amount of money a consumer is .pink[willing to pay] to acquire a specific quantity of a good.

*Example:* The highest price you would pay for 3 pounds of Stumptown coffee.

--

## Definition 2

> The .pink[minimum] amount of money a consumer is .pink[willing to accept] to give up a specific quantity of a good.

*Example:* The lowest amount of money for which you would willingly part with 3 pounds of Stumptown coffee.

---
# Marginal Value

## Definition 1

> The .pink[maximum] amount of money a consumer is .pink[willing to pay] to acquire one more unit of a good.

*Example:* The highest price you would pay for a cup of Stumptown coffee.

--

## Definition 2

> The .pink[minimum] amount of money a consumer is .pink[willing to accept] to give up one more unit of a good.

*Example:* The lowest amount of money for which you would willingly part with a cup of Stumptown coffee.

class: clear-slide

**Q:** After running a marathon, how might you value the first glass of water?

--

- How might you value the second glass relative to the first?

--

**Assumption 4:** Diminishing marginal value.

- *All else being equal*, the marginal value of a good decreases as you consume more of it.

- Applies to all goods and all individuals.

# Optimal Purchase

**Q:** How does a consumer decide how much of a good to purchase?

**A:** The consumer makes a decision *at the margin*.

- Purchase an additional unit if the marginal value of the additional unit exceeds the price.

- Do not purchase an additional unit if the price of the additional unit exceeds the marginal value.

- Keep purchasing until marginal value equals the price.

# Optimal Purchase

## Rule

--

If the consumer

- Stops purchasing where .green[MV .mono[>] P] .mono[==>] she bought .hi-green[too little].
- Stops purchasing where .purple[MV .mono[<] P] .mono[==>] she bought .hi-purple[too much]. 
- Makes a purchase where .pink[MV .mono[=] P] .mono[==>] she made the .hi-pink[optimal purchase].

# An Important Distinction

## .pink[Demand]

> The .pink[schedule of quantities] of a good that a consumer will buy per unit of time at .pink[various prices], everything else held constant.

A change in demand .pink[*shifts*] the demand curve.

## .green[Quantity demanded]

> The .green[specific quantity] that a consumer will buy per unit of time at a .green[specific price], everything else held constant.

A change in price leads to .green[*movement along*] the demand curve.

# The Diamond-Water Paradox

**Q:** Why are diamonds, mere frivolities, so much more expensive than water, which is essential to all life?

--

What resolves the paradox?

- Market prices reflect consumers' marginal values of those goods and not their total values.

# Sale Prices

**Q:** Why do firms offer "buy one, get one free" or "buy one, get one half off" sales?

--

Suppose MV.sub[1] .mono[=] .mono[$]4, MV.sub[2] .mono[=] .mono[$]2, and MV.sub[3] .mono[=] .mono[$]1. If the price of the item is .mono[$]5, how many units would the individual buy?

--

- Zero .mono[==>] the firm gets .mono[$]0 in revenue.

--

What if the deal was "buy one at .mono[$]5, get a second free?"

--

- The individual makes the exchange .mono[==>] the firm gets .mono[$]5 in revenue.

--

**A:** Induce consumers who wouldn't otherwise purchase to make a purchase .mono[-->] more revenue.

---
# Practice

**Q:** Based on the the table below, how many units would a consumer purchase if the price is .mono[$]59? By how much is she better off by purchasing that amount?

```{R, echo = F, escape = F}
data.frame(
  v1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),
  v2 = c(90, 85, "", 55, 40, "", 20),
  v3 = c("", "", 235, "", "", 360, "")
) %>% kable(
  escape = F,
  col.names = c("Unit", "Marginal Value", "Total Value"),
  align = c("c", "c", "c")#,
) %>%
row_spec(1:7, color = met_slate) %>%
row_spec(1:7, extra_css = "line-height: 110%;")
```

--

**A:** .pink[She purchases 3 units. Her consumer surplus is 235 .mono[-] 3 .mono[×] 59 .mono[=] 58.]
